This is my project. This is a system that schedules trucks to travel a specific map around Gainesville. I actually haven't looked at the code in while and can make no guarantees on its quality. I got a 100 on the code portion of the project, so it did the job well enough, but I know its not perfect.

This works with CLIPS 6.24 on windows for sure. I am unsure about its compatibility with any other environment.

To execute the program, just load the three .clp files, preferably in this order:
	1)newfacts1.clp OR newfacts2.clp OR newfacts3.clp, for each of the datasets
	2)pathrules.clp
	3)controlrules.clp


Then just (reset) and (run)
